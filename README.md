# ComicHub

Simple static web page made for comic fans to view and edit their favourite superhero comics and characters.
This project was made for practising Angular and was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Dependencies

-Bootstrap 4
-Ng-Bootstrap
-NgRx
-NgRx/Effects

## Challenges

The major obstacle was understanding how Redux work and how to manage the data flow with it. I spent most of the time setting up actions, reducers and effects for managing states with Redux.
Besides, applying TypeScript was a bit confusing at beginning but it soon made sense and I really like the concept of it.

## Future improvement

There are many improvements to be made to make it a better application:

-Implement user authentication.
-Connect to fully-functional back-end to complete the CRUD system.
-Write unit tests and End to End tests to catch bugs and help future development.
-Breakdown main app module into functional modules for a better structure.
